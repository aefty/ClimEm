data is structued as follows:
COLUMN_DESCRIPTION
0. Year
1. CO2EQ            - CO2 equivalence concentrations using CO2 radiative forcing relationship Q = 3.71/ln(2)*ln(C/278), aggregating all below anthropogenic forcings, including greenhouse gases (i.e. columns 3,4,5 and 8-35), plus aerosols etc. (not listed below).	
2. KYOTO-CO2EQ      - As column 1, but only aggregating greenhouse gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol (columns 3,4,5 and 8-19).	
3. CO2              - Atmospheric CO2 concentrations	
4. CH4              - Atmospheric CH4 concentrations	
5. N2O              - Atmospheric N2O concentrations	
6. FGASSUMHFC134AEQ - All flourinated gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol, i.e. HFCs, PFCs, and SF6 (columns 8-19) expressed as HFC134a equivalence concentrations.	
7. MHALOSUMCFC12EQ  - All flourinated gases controlled under the Montreal Protocol, i.e. CFCs, HCFCs, Halons, CCl4, CH3Br, CH3Cl (columns 20-35) expressed as CFC-12 equivalence concentrations.	
8. - 19.            - Flourinated Gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol	
20. - 35.           - Ozone Depleting Substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol
