SELF-LOG

- This solver tries to fit all three benchmarks (MESMO,MMM,LOVECLIM), assuming that all M_eq values are equal for a given model.

- It's an interesting idea, but the optimizer cannot find a solution. 

- It seems that the reservoir size for LOVECLIM is on a completely different scale than the other benchmarks, M_LO_eq in particular. 

- Correction bug fixed.

- Fix Atmosphere and lower Ocean to IPCC values.
